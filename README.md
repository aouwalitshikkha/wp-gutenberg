# Python & Wordpress Rest Api   

Python is a very powerful programming language. It is easy to use and has a lot of modules and libraries that allow you to do many different things.  

 WordPress is a content management system (CMS) that is written in PHP. Python can be used to control WordPress by using the WordPress XML-RPC/ REST API. The XML-RPC/ REST API is a remote procedure call system that allows you to interact with WordPress from a remote location. You can use the XML-RPC/ REST API to create, edit, and delete posts and pages on a WordPress site. 

 ## Installation
 ```python
 git clone https://github.com/aouwalitshikkha/wp-rest-api.git
 ```




## How can you contribute?
If you're a Python developer, then you know that one of the best ways to control a WordPress site is through the REST API. Unfortunately, there's no fullfilled Python library for the WordPress REST API. That's why we're building one.

Our goal is to build a complete Python library that you can use to control a WordPress site through the REST API. We're still in the early stages, but we're making progress.

If you're interested in helping out, we'd love to have you. We're looking for developers of all skill levels, from beginners to experts. If you're not a Python developer, but you're interested in helping out, we're also looking for people to help with documentation, testing, and more.

If you're interested in helping us build the WordPress REST API Python library,. We'd love to have you on board.
